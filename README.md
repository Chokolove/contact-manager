<h1># contact-manager</h1>

<p>This is a contact manager app guided by SoloLearn React course on his base.</p>

<p>02/08/19 -> Now I'm working with someone else (<a href=https://github.com/JavierCervilla>Javier Cervilla</a>) in the style css using SASS and a <a href=https://github.com/ftdgomez>Daniel Gomez</a> mini framework called makeup. Source: https://github.com/ftdgomez/makeup</p>

Planned features:
<ul><il>More filters on contact info</il>
  <il>More data to collect from user (name, phone, birthday...)</il>
  <il>Some kind of link to Vizum</il>
  <il>Online or local storage</il></ul>
